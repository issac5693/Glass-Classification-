## Glass Classification using Random Forest <br>
Glass Classification allows us to provide the chemical properties of the glass as an the input and return "what the glass is best suitable for" as the output. <br>
I've used the *RandomForestAlgorithm* from the *sklearn* pakage and got an accuracy of 88%,
I've attached both the ipynb file that I used to built the model and the model itself. 
You can use the *joblib* python package to load the model
